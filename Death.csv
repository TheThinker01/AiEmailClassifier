Dear TEST PENSIONS

Thank you for your email.

However, I am confused. TEST’s letter of 28th September has been received and my letter sent by email on 5th October acknowledged this.

My letter of 5th October 2020 also provided the bank account details for Mr LMNO (spouse of the deceased) as requested in the letter from TEST.

Please confirm that the funeral benefit is now being processed and will be sent to Mr LMNO shortly.

Please also let me have details of your complaints procedure, as this is now, completely unacceptable.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

	Hi,
	 
	I am writing to you today to inform you of ABC XYZ's (born 01 Jan 1400) death on June 1, im Manilla Philippines.
	I am his ex-wife Sandrine Bessiere-Smith. I worked for Fin Corp  UK (empl# 1235) and Fin Corp Sweden then Fin Corp 2 UK (empl # 123) from 1994 to 2001. Michael was employed by Fin Corp in Sweden and the UK as well, prior to the CGI acquisition. 
	 
	I recently received his personal papers and I have gone through his UK pension papers and while I know he did not request his pension paid when he left to the Philippines (since he was still working when he passed), I wonder if there would be any money owed to his son, next of kin. I do not have the details of any policy with Fin Corp. Michael's NIN was ZZ123123Z.
				
	Would you be able to help me with this ? I have a lot of documentation to provide such as Death and medical certificate, passport copy, birth certificate, proof of next of kin, marriage and divorce certificate, last known address, etc...

Hi, can you help?
 
My Father, ABC XYZ, is a retired employee of Fin Corp, he retired approximately 30 years ago’ and is a member of the Test Pension Plan.
DOB – 01/01/1400. NI No. ZZ123123Z PAYE Ref TST12345678 Pension Payroll No. TST12345678
Address: 10 Test Road, Test Street, AA12 123
 
He is now 89 years of age, and sadly in hospital receiving palliative care and is not expected to survive more than a few days.
Who do I need to inform after he dies, and as he will be survived by his wife, will she be eligible for any benefit after his death, importantly we are trying to put a care package in place for my Mum,
as she herself has healthcare needs.
 
Thank you for your help

Good day,

I have spoken with one of your advisers today but I need some clarification please.

My father Mr STU VWX NI no ZZ123123Z Ref TST12345678. Currently as my father died and had received his pension in advance the estate owes £1,111.11 which I understand. I am happy to have the money is paid out from what was his joint account with my mother, she will be keeping the account to receive payments from yourselves. could she then receive her payments?

I was also told that before any payments could be made to her, a copy of the probate must be supplied, but I see no reason for this as pensions fall outside the scope of probate. We are in the process of applying for Probate, which will probably happen end of January.

Can you confirm we can pay the amount owing and confirm that a copy of the probate is not required to release payments to my mother DEF.

If you have any questions please feel free to let me know. Thank you in advance,

Kind regards

ABC

Following the emails below my father XYZ has received a letter from you dated 01 January 1400 regarding the death on my mother DEF - your reference TST12345678.
In that letter you say you need to see certain original documents being my fathers birth certificate (or passport), marriage certificate and death certificate.
To say the least requiring original documents to be sent around the world is both unusual and high risk.
In dealing will my mothers estate no other pension provider (XXX or XXX) has asked for anything other than certified copies of documents.
To this end I spoke with a representative of TEST deceased estates department in XXX. He thought your need to be extraordinary and said certified copies suffice here.
Questions:
1.Can my father send certified copies authorised by an appropriate authority or a TEST officer at you XXX office.
2.What document or documents would be acceptable in lieu of a XXX marriage certificate as my father is unable to locate this document.
I await your reply.

Good afternoon
Further to your postal letter, dated 23rd September 2020, and my subsequent telephone call last week with one of your colleagues, I have been advised to provide some more financial information regarding my late father's TEST pension fund, and some additional ""Impact info"" I am now facing having been my dad's carer.
My dad received his weekly state pension (with an element of pension credit), as well as a payment in the form of Attendance Allowance every 4 weeks. As my dad's carer for the last 11 years, and his sole carer since 2009, and his appointee since 2017, I started receiving a weekly payment in the form of Carers Allowance around 2015. In dad's final years TEST started paying his income into my bank account for his own welfare (elements of XX AND XX with finances). We were instructed to always make sure dad received this but to monitor his spending as he wasn't great with handling his money. I therefore enclose attachments of the above, taken from my bank statements.
I believe this is important information requested that your colleague advised to forward to yourselves. I also want to offer you an impact insight as to, regardless of being an adult in my own right, how interdependent my position became with dad too.
I had to give up full time work in 2015 due to ill health, namely FIbromyalgia, and shortly after my partner had to give up his full time employment to help with my own care, as well as that of my father. This was an awful situation to find ourselves in, and we struggled by as best we could. When I received the carers allowance that was naturally of great help, but without the odd financial crutch here and there from dad, from his attendance allowance to attend to his needs, the situation would've been harder. There was never a requirement for dad to provide this, and indeed it was certainly not a regular helping hand, but on occasions when our teenage daughter was needing things like uniform for school, Xmas etc etc, it was a very welcome and lovely helping hand.
Naturally upon dad's passing we knew things would go back to a certain level of hardship, with the carers allowance ending 8 weeks after dad's passing, and no more loving occasional helping hand. Of course this is just how life is, and no money will ever replace my longing to have at the very least one more cup of tea or a natter with him, and I terribly miss his persistent curmudgeonly manner. In short, his passing continues to be felt and will do for however long that will be.
I hope this email and information requested is both sufficient and helpful for the panel, and I shall await your further consideration in due course.
Yours sincerely
Ms ABC

I am the next of kin to XYZ who died earlier this year.

We received communication from you regarding regarding my deceased father's pension and we returned the required form with death certificate some weeks ago.

I have subsequently received correspondence from you saying you have not had a response from me. I have tried to call with no success so would like to know how this can be resolved.
