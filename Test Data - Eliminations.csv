Hi

Please find attached a letter of Authority and Scheme information request letter that was previously sent to XYZ in September 2020.  Can you please confirm receipt and arrange for this information to be provided to me as a matter of urgency.

We have received other CETV’s for this client which are administered by yourselves which are due to expire at end of December 2020, therefore we would appreciate your assistance to expedite this request.  We have unfortunately spent some time trying to trace the administrators of this scheme and I understand the benefits were invested through XYZ. Your assistance in this matter would be gratefully appreciated.

Password to follow.

Sorry this is  quite urgent as docs only valid until 01/01/1400

Documents received to transfer client benefits can we email across discharge forms signed by client or are originals required? No adviser sign off doc was attached is this required? Can we send across our standard document of can you provide such a document via email asap? Again is original required in post or can we email?

I have a SIPP with over £100,000 in it so looking ahead I am conscious that over the next few years I may come close to the lifetime allowance when I also consider the value of my Test pension?

My understanding is that to work out the amount of my Test pension within the lifetime allowance I multiply the annual pension payment by 20. Is it possible to tell me what my pension is (for lifetimes allowance calculation) at 55 amd 60?

Much appreciated

Good Morning Mr ABC,

Firstly, please accept my apologies on behalf of XYZ for the problems that you have been experiencing. We take matters like this very seriously and I will do everything I can to assist you. 

Your email has come through to our specialist SIPP and SSAS Team mailbox and we are unfortunately not the area that look after your pension scheme. We also do not have access to the main pensions administration area records to enable me to search for your scheme and trace your policy. However, I have referred your email across to our Complaints Team and also to a Senior Manager in our main Pensions Administration area, to enable them to trace your scheme and make contact with you regarding this. They should be in touch with you shortly.  

In the meantime, I can also confirm that there is a Customer Service Centre for our main Pensions Administration area, which you can contact if you need to in the future by telephone on +91 012345678 or by email to test.pensions@pensions.com.

To help them to trace your scheme in the future, you may need to quote the name of the scheme, your policy reference number and your name and National Insurance number. 

I hope this is of assistance to you for the future and please rest assured that someone will be in touch with you shortly regarding your scheme.  

Kind Regards

Hi

I’ve sent the below message to the contact us page on your website.

""Someone needs to contact me or reply to Test IFA, with regards to transferring this pension to them, you don't respond to me you don't respond to them, nobody answers your phone. This request was first made in September and will be sent to the ombudsman this week unless you actually reply to someone""


I'll try here as well, can someone respond to this before I’m left no option but to go to the ombudsman, from my point of view you have 20k of my money you refuse to handover, I consider that a form of theft.

I know someone looks at this as I’ve been sent three useless letters in the post that achieve nothing. You need to reply to TEST IFA when they contact you.

I thought DEF had the worst customer service ever, but at least they eventually respond, this is just corporate stonewalling, have you tried using your service? it’s pathetic.
