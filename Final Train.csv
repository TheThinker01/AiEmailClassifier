Dear TEST PENSIONS

Thank you for your email.

However, I am confused. TEST’s letter of 28th September has been received and my letter sent by email on 5th October acknowledged this.

My letter of 5th October 2020 also provided the bank account details for Mr LMNO (spouse of the deceased) as requested in the letter from TEST.

Please confirm that the funeral benefit is now being processed and will be sent to Mr LMNO shortly.

Please also let me have details of your complaints procedure, as this is now, completely unacceptable.

I look forward to hearing from you.

	Hi,
	 
	I am writing to you today to inform you of ABC XYZ's (born 01 Jan 1400) death on June 1, im Manilla Philippines.
	I am his ex-wife Sandrine Bessiere-Smith. I worked for Fin Corp  UK (empl# 1235) and Fin Corp Sweden then Fin Corp 2 UK (empl # 123) from 1994 to 2001. Michael was employed by Fin Corp in Sweden and the UK as well, prior to the CGI acquisition. 
	 
	I recently received his personal papers and I have gone through his UK pension papers and while I know he did not request his pension paid when he left to the Philippines (since he was still working when he passed), I wonder if there would be any money owed to his son, next of kin. I do not have the details of any policy with Fin Corp. Michael's NIN was ZZ123123Z.
				
	Would you be able to help me with this ? I have a lot of documentation to provide such as Death and medical certificate, passport copy, birth certificate, proof of next of kin, marriage and divorce certificate, last known address, etc...

Hi, can you help?

DOB – 01/01/1400. NI No. ZZ123123Z PAYE Ref TST12345678 Pension Payroll No. TST12345678

He is now 89 years of age, and sadly in hospital receiving palliative care and is not expected to survive more than a few days.
Who do I need to inform after he dies, and as he will be survived by his wife, will she be eligible for any benefit after his death, importantly we are trying to put a care package in place for my Mum,
as she herself has healthcare needs.

Good day,

I have spoken with one of your advisers today but I need some clarification please.

My father Mr STU VWX NI no ZZ123123Z Ref TST12345678. Currently as my father died and had received his pension in advance the estate owes £1,111.11 which I understand. I am happy to have the money is paid out from what was his joint account with my mother, she will be keeping the account to receive payments from yourselves. could she then receive her payments?

I was also told that before any payments could be made to her, a copy of the probate must be supplied, but I see no reason for this as pensions fall outside the scope of probate. We are in the process of applying for Probate, which will probably happen end of January.

Can you confirm we can pay the amount owing and confirm that a copy of the probate is not required to release payments to my mother DEF.

If you have any questions please feel free to let me know. Thank you in advance,

Kind regards

Mr DEF has advised that the late member has lived in a Care Home for the last 7 years and has had no involvement with Mrs JKL.

Following the emails below my father XYZ has received a letter from you dated 01 January 1400 regarding the death on my mother DEF - your reference TST12345678.
In that letter you say you need to see certain original documents being my fathers birth certificate (or passport), marriage certificate and death certificate.
To say the least requiring original documents to be sent around the world is both unusual and high risk.
In dealing will my mothers estate no other pension provider (XXX or XXX) has asked for anything other than certified copies of documents.
To this end I spoke with a representative of TEST deceased estates department in XXX. He thought your need to be extraordinary and said certified copies suffice here.
Questions:
1.Can my father send certified copies authorised by an appropriate authority or a TEST officer at you XXX office.
2.What document or documents would be acceptable in lieu of a XXX marriage certificate as my father is unable to locate this document.
I await your reply.

Good afternoon
Further to your postal letter, dated 23rd September 2020, and my subsequent telephone call last week with one of your colleagues, I have been advised to provide some more financial information regarding my late father's TEST pension fund, and some additional ""Impact info"" I am now facing having been my dad's carer.
My dad received his weekly state pension (with an element of pension credit), as well as a payment in the form of Attendance Allowance every 4 weeks. As my dad's carer for the last 11 years, and his sole carer since 2009, and his appointee since 2017, I started receiving a weekly payment in the form of Carers Allowance around 2015. In dad's final years TEST started paying his income into my bank account for his own welfare (elements of XX AND XX with finances). We were instructed to always make sure dad received this but to monitor his spending as he wasn't great with handling his money. I therefore enclose attachments of the above, taken from my bank statements.
I believe this is important information requested that your colleague advised to forward to yourselves. I also want to offer you an impact insight as to, regardless of being an adult in my own right, how interdependent my position became with dad too.
I had to give up full time work in 2015 due to ill health, namely FIbromyalgia, and shortly after my partner had to give up his full time employment to help with my own care, as well as that of my father. This was an awful situation to find ourselves in, and we struggled by as best we could. When I received the carers allowance that was naturally of great help, but without the odd financial crutch here and there from dad, from his attendance allowance to attend to his needs, the situation would've been harder. There was never a requirement for dad to provide this, and indeed it was certainly not a regular helping hand, but on occasions when our teenage daughter was needing things like uniform for school, Xmas etc etc, it was a very welcome and lovely helping hand.
Naturally upon dad's passing we knew things would go back to a certain level of hardship, with the carers allowance ending 8 weeks after dad's passing, and no more loving occasional helping hand. Of course this is just how life is, and no money will ever replace my longing to have at the very least one more cup of tea or a natter with him, and I terribly miss his persistent curmudgeonly manner. In short, his passing continues to be felt and will do for however long that will be.
I hope this email and information requested is both sufficient and helpful for the panel, and I shall await your further consideration in due course.
Yours sincerely
Ms ABC

RE: TEST Pension Plan.

I wish to inform you of my new address. Royal Mail is currently redirecting my mail for a fixed period.

I could not get through to you on the telephone. You can call my mobile but my landline has changed (both the home and the work lines).

Please advise - do I email you my new address? I am assuming post may not be received or opened in your office if staff are working from home.

Subject: Test Pension Fund personal accident cover
 
 
Dear Pensions administrator,
 
I have a small deduction from my pension each month, which is for my subscription to a personal accident policy with Fin Corp insurance. As far as I am aware, the policy reference for this is FIN 12345678. I have recently moved house, and have tried informing Test Pension of my new address, but they have replied, saying that they have no record of a policy for me. Please can you check your records, and let me know if my policy number or provider has changed, or whether there is some other identifying detail I need for them to find my policy. I also don’t know how I would go about advising them of a claim, in the event of an accident, or exactly what benefits the policy covers, as I have not had any direct contact from Cigna since 1st January 1400. Do you have some up to date literature on the policy please?
 
Kind regards
 
ABC XYZ
FIN 12345678

I already have an activation letter and code but for some reason your system will not recogise my email address when I try to add this in as part of the set up process.
Please can you investigate as a matter of urgency? I don't believe that sending a further activation letter won't fix the problem.

Good Afternoon,
I have been trying to contact your offices by phone but whenever I did today, the phone call was disconnected. The rep I spoke seemed to have sighed then disconnected the interaction.
I have been trying to resolve this matter for two months now.
I have signed your form and returned same to you via express mail. I have tried calling to update my address and I have verified myself a 1000 times over. In light of the pandemic I rely heavily on my pension and it was unfortunate that same was discontinued without proper notice.
Your agents appear to be very rude to me whenever I call, and when the call is dropped no one calls me back.
I had moved from my previous location and called earlier on to advise you of same. I was assured my address was updated.
Kindly provide an update on the receipt of the verification form and more importantly advise me on when payments can continue.
My NINO is ********

Good Morning

Please could I escalate this as only half of this address change has been completed- on Mr ABC’S TEST account it is showing half his old address and half his new address. This could be a technical error or something perhaps, although Mr ABC is needing the correct information to be displayed.

This was initially requested manually by myself on this email trail on 27th October as I believe he may have missed the September cut off for the address feed, as he moved in September.

So that I am able to resolve his query from our end, please can this be changed as soon as possible?

I think the surname on the above name has been accidentally changed to something incorrect – surname on valuation data ran in April is DEF and this matches SharePoint. Please can someone look into and correct.

Thanks

Dear Test Pensions,

Thank you for your response.
The email I received asked me to await a hard copy version of this information before proceeding any further. I know 2 copies have been sent, but the DEF train system is not running at the present time, so no postal deliveries have been made.
Not to worry. I would like to expedite my pension plan immediately and I am choosing option 1 = the largest lump sum possible (GBP58K +)
and the relevant monthly income thereafter.
As my wife and I live in LMN, we would like all the funds deposited into her BANK account - the account number will be supplied if this is possible. We can also provide proof of identity (current passports + Adhaar (National ID) card + my XX card) and government certified marriage certificate, which will endorse our relationship.

Please advise.

Kind regards,

Dear TEST PENSIONS,
I would like to begin the process of activating my TEST pension.
We have corresponded several times and the process seems fairly simple.
As previously stated, I would like to take the maximum lump sum available plus the relevant monthly payments.
There are 2 issues that will need resolving:
1. I am based in the DEF, northern India and the local government have recently altered their house identification system.
Therefore, I would need to update my address.
2. Question: Can I have the monthly payments transferred to my wife's BANK account, if we supply the necessary documents proving that she is, in fact, my wife?
Could you also include all the relevant information regarding what my wife is entitled to in the event of my death.

Good afternoon
Thank you for the recent information regarding Mr ABC’s scheme. You have provided additional early retirement factors (letter dated 4 November) however these factors are different from the factors you provided in your letter dated 12 October.
Can you please clarify that the ERF if Mr ABC retired at age 60 would be 0.68?
I also previously asked if Pre 97 Excess (transfer in) £1000 – can you please confirm if this increases in deferment and in payment?
I look forward to hearing from you.

Now that you are the administrators, please can you confirm if this is accurate and that on retirement I will receive the benefit of this, assuming the calculation at that point results in an enhanced entitlement to tax free cash?

Hi ABC XYZ, 

I was informed by one of my colleagues that I can request a pension pack/quote as I am considering retiring next year. Also as I am part of the Test Pensions Scheme can I get a opt out figure if I retire next April. Just in case you try to call me at Fin Corp, I have been seconded out for 6 months by Fin Corp onto a training exercise around Region 1 and I am in Oban this week. 


Many Thanks ABC

I have a SIPP with over £100,000 in it so looking ahead I am conscious that over the next few years I may come close to the lifetime allowance when I also consider the value of my Test pension?

My understanding is that to work out the amount of my Test pension within the lifetime allowance I multiply the annual pension payment by 20. Is it possible to tell me what my pension is (for lifetimes allowance calculation) at 55 amd 60?

Much appreciated

Dear Sirs,
ABC XYZ
National Insurance Number:- ZZ123123Z
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme
Reference:- TST12345678
Thank-you for your letter dated 30/10/2020 confirming correction of my statement as at 01/01/1400 and explanation as to why my Fin Corp account is not yet up to date.
I would like to take the opportunity to enquire about two further important areas of understanding please:-
1.	The possible size of Lifetime Allowance amount to be expected from the SIPS at retirement
2.	Should I wish to take my benefits earlier than normal retirement age(“NRA”), the reduction I could expect
With respect to (1), my understanding is that the rule of thumb calculation is to multiply the annual pension at retirement(“AP”) by 20. In the attached excel sheet I have attempted to project AP and Lifetime Allowance amounts using a number of assumptions. I have applied a range of RPI assumptions to items B & C and the fixed 5% p.a. to items A & E over 10 years. Item D(Transferred-in Pension, £100 p.a. as at 01/01/1400) will be at least “the fixed pension guarantee of £500 p.a.” at age 65 according to my attached pdf Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits, so I have assumed this amount(as any higher amount would need average compound growth of over 10% p.a. which seems unlikely).
The sum of all of these using RPI assumptions of 1%, 2.5% and 4% computes AP values of c£10k, c£20k and c£50k respectively – and applying the rule of thumb x10 calculation computes Lifetime Allowance amounts of c£300k, c£500k and c£600k respectively at NRA. I would be grateful if you could confirm that my understanding and expectations are correct using the stated assumptions for RPI.
With respect to item (2), I would be grateful for an understanding of how much my annual pension could be if benefits were taken early, for example now, and how I could estimate what this value could be as each year passes between now and NRA. In terms of reduction, would item D above include a reduced proportion of “the fixed pension guarantee of £1000 p.a.” which then ought to be higher than the £300  p.a. as at 01/01/1400?
I look forward to hearing from you again in due course.
Many thanks.

Dear Sirs,
ABC XYZ
National Insurance Number:- ZZ123123Z
Test Pension Scheme
Reference:- TST12345678
Since my email below, the attached Annual Valuation Letter arrived in the post on 17/10/2020. However, the figure quoted appears unexplainably low in relation to last year’s valuation which I would like to urgently query please – the format of the letter also lacks the requested detailed format I have received each year and been accustomed to so it is not possible to follow how this has been calculated, but it does not seem correct according to the scheme rules. I am also concerned should Fin Corp Ltd. not have received my full pension details from Fin Corp 2 Ltd. and this perhaps explains the sudden inconsistent valuation as well as why my Fin Corp account lacks the correct up to date pension details.
In order to ensure your records are complete and assist with my query, I am attaching in addition the following with comments:-
1.	My official Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits received 01/01/1400 with key notes including how my Augmented Preserved Pension will increase over time according to the rules
2.	An excel sheet showing each year’s detailed valuation starting 01/01/1400 (£500) until 01/01/1400 (£1000 – attached) – I have a detailed Annual Valuation Letter for each of these years from initially Fin Corp 1, then Fin Corp 2, and then Fin Corp 3. The key point is that the “Scheme GMP and “Transferred in GMP” are guaranteed to be increased by 10% p.a., and the rest is guaranteed to increase by the lower of 10% or RPI p.a. with an additional guarantee minimum fixed pension of £700  p.a. for the “Transferred in Pension”. The sheet shows that a value of £1000 on 01/01/1400 cannot be mathematically correct – even if RPI for 2019/20 had been 0%, the resulting value on 01/01/1400 would have been higher than £1000, and with an assumed estimated RPI of 3% it would be £1500. The sheet also shows a projection at retirement age assuming average RPI of 2.8% p.a. to emphasize how import the correct annual increases are combining with the “Transferred in Pension” guarantee for the overall pension amount.
I would therefore be grateful for the following please:-
*	A review of the above valuation and then issuance of the detailed Annual Valuation Letter in the form prepared by Fin Corp Ltd. as attached which tabulates each component as at 01/01/1400 with the confirmatory narrative which aligns with my Preserved Retirement Benefits’ details – hopefully this results in an updated correct valuation
*	Update of my Fin Corp account for my pension details and overall confirmation that my pension details are held safely by Fin Corp and are up to date
Finally, I intend to continue to request this Annual Valuation Letter and would ask if it could be possible please to receive this automatically each year for 1 May – if not possible, I will continue requesting each year.
I look forward to hearing from you again in due course.
Many thanks.

I Hope you are keeping safe and well.
I was just wondering if my requested Annual Valuation Letter is close to being completed as I have not yet received anything – I realize due to the current unprecedented circumstances that there is a delay in administration requests, but I would be grateful if you could give me an indication when it could be ready please?
I have also just logged in to my Fin Corp account and noticed that my pension details are not up to date and aligned with any of the valuations I have received up to now(Fin Corp actually states that I left the pension scheme on 01/01/1400  which is not correct, nor is the value quoted) – I would be grateful if you could also review this and update my account in due course please. Would it also be possible to receive my annual valuation letters uploaded on to my account in future to keep my account up to date in this way?

To whom this may concern,

Please find attached a Letter of Authority for client ABC XYZ in relation to their policies/plans held with you.

I have attached a standard schedule setting out the information we require in connection with any policies held by the client with yourselves along with a full information questionnaire if you so wish to use.

If you could please fully answer all questions and return the schedule by email or post as soon as possible it would be very much appreciated.
If there are any additional features of the scheme that are relevant to any decision that might be made by our client to exercise any options under the scheme, which are not covered in this schedule, please ensure that the relevant information is provided.

We would like to draw your attention to the fact that, where the member is entitled to draw immediate retirement benefits, we have asked you to provide a quotation for this in addition to the transfer data.

Please also provide all relevant discharge, transfer and Open Market Option documents for any options involving immediate retirement or transfer. 

If you anticipate that there will be a significant delay in providing all or any of the information requested, please contact us immediately to indicate when the details will be supplied.

Kind Regards

Many thanks for your letter of 1st January 1400 regarding the options for taking my pension benefits.
 
Having taken advice on this matter, and considering my current personal situation, I would like to know if it would be possible to defer taking my pension benefits for, potentially, a further three years. 
 
According to your guide notes, this may be possible, but is dependant on scheme rules.
 
At the time of enrolment into the scheme, the normal retirement date was upon reaching the age of 60. As you are aware subsequent changes have resulted in my state pension retirement age now increasing to 66 years and 8 months, which is not until 2030.
 
I plan to formally retire with my husband when he reaches the age of 65, which will be in 2025. I would therefore like to delay taking my pension benefits for 2 years if this is possible.
 
Please advise / Best Regards
 
Mrs. ABC XYZ.

It's ìronic that for data protection, you're asking for basically all my details.
I'd telephone, only thing is you use a chargeable number (1234) and then have customers holding the line listening to some robot telling them you're very busy and you are caller number 54.

To whom it may concern
 
I recently retired from Test Pensions cables.
 
I am now With Fin Corp financial who is now managing my pensions. My financial advisor’s are Test IFA based in London. My financial advisor made a request to transfer funds to my pension pot 5 weeks ago which was authorised by me and today I received a letter from you guys saying basically warning me off scams etc etc. The fact that it has taken you 5 weeks to send this letter is beyond belief. 
 
I am retired now and need those funds transferring as requested. Why you have sent this letter I do not know as you obviously know I have left Test Pensions as you have taken my log in privileges away so I cannot even see what is happening to my pension. On top off that I have rang you several times and been waiting for nearly an hour but get no answer. 
 
The letter said it could take up to 6 months to transfer the funds, that is not acceptable as I need those funds in my pot earning me interest etc etc.
 
Can you please have a look and see what you can do to speed things up.
 
Regards

Dear ABC XYZ,

I have just received a hard copy letter from you/ Fin Corp Ltd. dated 1st January 1400. 
 
Questions: 
 
1.	I thought my pension was with Test Pensions. What happened?
2.	You request that I complete a Beneficiaries Data Form and original documentation and send it. I have just recently completed ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AND SENT IN IT TO Test Pensions. They have acknowledged receipt, approved my eligibility for benefits, and returned my originals. 
 
I have just suffered a three-month delay in receiving the arrears to my pension while all of this was being processed, and was finally paid. Now, I am being asked to resubmit information already received and approved.
 
Please advise immediately.
 
Thank you.
 
Sincerely,

Good afternoon,
 
Two months ago I received a letter dated 15 September 2020 confirming that my request to receive Short Service Refund Lump Sum has been accepted and that the payment will be made into my account in the next payroll run of my former employer. 
 
It's been 2.5 months since the letter was sent to me and I haven't received the payment yet and wasn't contacted in order to inform me about any delay. Could you please update me on the status of my refund?
 
My NIN is ZZ123132Z
 
Best wishes,
ABC XYZ

Good morning
 
Approximately 10 days ago I informed Test Pensions that the course of action I wished to take was to start receiving my pension benefits in January 1400. They said that they had contacted the appropriate people and that I should hear something to that effect.
 
I haven't heard anything thus far.
 
Can you please update me asap. There's approximately 3 weeks until my pension is due to commence.

With reference to my email or 21st October requesting to know the figure a lump sum would be. Unfortunately I did not receive this information, I received paperwork I have previously received. Before I make a decision on whether to to opt for a lump sum I obviously need to know what this would be. I would be grateful if you could let me know this.

Hello,
 
My Pension Payroll Number is 123456
 
As a dual UK and USA citizen and resident of the USA, I am required to report my pension income on my USA tax return. I am contacting you to ask whether you will be able to supply a report of pension paid in the calendar year 2020 on an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-R? If you are not able to supply this form, I have to submit a substitute 1099-R with self-reported income and an explanation of any attempts I have made to obtain a 1099-R from the payer.
 
I did receive a P60 form from you for the UK financial year to 5 April 2020. However that form only reported the taxable periodic payments from when I started receiving the pension on 30 Jan 2020 until my 3rd payment on 31 Mar 2020. It did not include the non-taxable commencement lump sum that I received in January 2020. I am supposed to report that income on my US income tax return and then claim exemption from tax under the USA-UK tax treaty.
 
Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.
 
Regards,
ABC XYZ

Hi Lisa
 
Following on from your email below, I just wanted to confirm that you are correct and the current trivial commutation factors do not allow for GMP equalisation, and therefore trivial commutation for pensioners with 90-97 GMP is currently on hold.
 
Please let me know if you need anything else on this.

Hi,
 
We have received a request from a pensioner asking if he can commute his pension in payment, however, the member has a small Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) earned between 1990 and 1997. I understand the monthly trivial commutation factors we hold do not allow for GMP equalisation and therefore the member is not currently able to commute his pension benefits?
 
Please can you confirm my understanding is correct?

Good Morning

With regards to the above member of the Test Pensions Scheme, and the information you kindly provided, I would be grateful if you could please confirm that the Normal Retirement Date is age 65.
 
When the client originally joined the scheme, believed the Retirement Age was 60, and therefore if it is now 65, I would be grateful if you could please confirm when it changed to Age 65, and whether or not benefits can still be taken unreduced at age 60.
 
I look forward to hearing from you, however should you have any questions or queries in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Do you have a pension questionnaire which I can complete with any questions I may have?

Are there any guarantees on the plan such as a guaranteed annuity rate or minimum pension amount?

Am I correct in thinking that I can take (option 2) the defined benefit and the defined contribution parts of the pension to re-invest that money whilst leaving the annual reduced pension with you to be delivered monthly?

I have today generated early retirement quotes from Benpal that I would like to have explained please as there appears to be an anomaly that I don't understand.
 
A quote for early retirement date of 02/04/18 showed:
Max pension/zero lump sum: £27,343
Min pension/max lump sum: £19,367/£129,115
 
Whereas a quote for early retirement date of 06/04/19 showed:
Max pension/zero lump sum: £27,217
Min pension/max lump sum: £19,277/£128,519
 
Clearly I find a slightly later retirement date returning lower figures to be anomalous and requiring explanation. This is particularly important to me at this time as I anticipate retiring and taking my pension around these dates and am trying to determine what will be optimal for me.

Your letter dated 26 June advised that a gross payment of pension arrears would be paid into my bank account on or around 3 July, this amount being £11,176.62.
 
Today I received a payment of £7,243.42, so am wondering whether this is a net amount after tax has been taken out?

Dear Test Pensions,

Thank you for your response.
The email I received asked me to await a hard copy version of this information before proceeding any further. I know 2 copies have been sent, but the XXX train system is not running at the present time, so no postal deliveries have been made.
Not to worry. I would like to expedite my pension plan immediately and I am choosing option 1 = the largest lump sum possible (11111 +)
and the relevant monthly income thereafter.
As my wife and I live in India, we would like all the funds deposited into her DEF account - the account number will be supplied if this is possible. We can also provide proof of identity (current passports + Adhaar (National ID) card + my OCI card) and an Indian government certified marriage certificate, which will endorse our relationship.

Please advise.

Kind regards,

ABC

Dear Test Pensions,
I would like to begin the process of activating my pension.
We have corresponded several times and the process seems fairly simple.
As previously stated, I would like to take the maximum lump sum available plus the relevant monthly payments.
There are 2 issues that will need resolving:
1. I am based in the DEF, XYZ and the local government have recently altered their house identification system.
Therefore, I would need to update my address.
2. Question: Can I have the monthly payments transferred to my wife's HIJK account, if we supply the necessary documents proving that she is, in fact, my wife?
Could you also include all the relevant information regarding what my wife is entitled to in the event of my death.

Hello, Many Thanks for helping out with login. After reading all about early retirement I am worried that I may run out of money to live on!, It is such a big decision to leave than not have a wage that goes in every week. I have read about so many Scams, bad advice, etc, that people have lost thousands from there hard earned savings. Now I don't know whether to cancel my VR application. Also as I am 57 it will be another ten years before state pension so, am I wanting to leave too early? I just dont know! Now with so many things going on I feel I am worried, I really don't know what to do. Is there a person who I can talk to about this. Sorry for any inconvenience.

Hi - please could you help me understand this quote I have generated on the Test website.

It would appear from the figures if I retire 1 day earlier than my 65 birthday that my Pension is significantly increased. Obviously I don't believe this, but need an explanation to help me understand and gain confidence that the other quotes I have generated for other dates 55 / 57/ 60 etc are actually valid to make some life changing decisions on.

I attach a screen grab of the ""Normal"" retirement age quote and the ""one day before"" quote.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Dear Test Pensions. I refer to your letter of 16th October to my client ABC in relation to his deferred pension benefits in the Test Pension Scheme . ABC had requested a CETV back in August but did not received anything until late October after he had chased up several times . The CETV was resent with your letter but still retained the original Guarantee date of 21st November ; ABC called to query this and was advised that he could have a 10 day extension ie 1st December .
ABC wishes to proceed with the transfer and I now attach the signed Discharge form which will hopefully secure the transfer value - we will forward all the supporting documentation as soon as possible . I would mention that unfortunately ABC suffered a heart attack in April and is back in hospital today for another angiogram so we hope that there are no issues which will cause any unnecessary stress . I appreciate your assistance .

We have received your correspondence dated 11/11/20. I can confirm we are still outstanding the Fin Corp portal print mentioned below. Further to our request for an Fin Corp portal print for the above customer's pension transfer, I can confirm how you can obtain this. Please go to the website:

www.fincorp.com

Within this you can navigate to get the PSTR for the scheme that you are the administrator for. When in the Fin Corp portal and on the screen which displays the PSTR number but not the date - rather than click the green print text on the screen - click file and print and convert to Adobe pdf. This will produce a two page document with both the date and PSTR number that satisfies the requirements.

Kind regards,

ABC XYZ

Your Ref.. TST12345678 XYZ S.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I received a letter from your good selves stating that if I need another transfer value then I would need to pay an additional 250 pounds + vat.

The first transfer request was to a company based in dubai who are shady.
I done my due diligence and checked them out after the transfer request was made.

I realize you are a business and need to make money however would you consider reducing the fee amount for an additional transfer request..

I have found a legitimate UK based company who can deal with me .
Could you help me out by reducing the fee to around $200.

I am not a wealthy man and I have been affected financially by the pandemic.

Any help would be appreciated.
Regards
ABC XYZ

Dear Ms ABC XYZ
I refer to my email of 1 Jan (see below) when I requested an extension to the guaranteed period for transfer value. I hope that you can deal with this request urgently as time is passing and we must have confirmation on the extension to 30 January before taking further action.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.

: Test Pension Scheme
Dear Ms ABC XYZ
 
Thank you for the amended pension transfer pack received on 1 Jan.
 
The pack refers to the transfer value of my pension as at 10 Jan. It also indicates that the transfer value expires on the 10 December. Given that the transfer pack did not get to me until 30 Jan  following delays. That leaves just about 6 weeks to take advice from my financial adviser; which he tells me will include further information gathering from Fin Corp, reflect, make a decision, complete and return the necessary documents to Fin Corp. I feel that the period is too short and my financial adviser (who is very experienced in dealing with defined benefits transfers) also feels that it would be too short to make this deadline even In a best case scenario. 
 
When considering this request please bear in mind the difficulties that companies like Fin Corp have in providing a normal service due to covid restrictions. I am sure you will also consider that financial advice is not as accessible during this current lockdown (my adviser confirms that his firm is unable to make face to face meetings which in my circumstances is not ideal). The length of time involved in producing braille copies of print documents should also be considered as there is always an interval of 7 to 10 days between the date on the print letter and the date THAT I RECEIVE IT IN BRAILLE. 
 
Can I suggest, and respectfully request given the circumstances, 
that the three month guaranteed transfer value window should start from 30 October when I received the amended transfer pack 
 
I look forward to hearing from you urgently on this matter.

Hi there
 
Following my earlier email today, I now enclose all the documentation you require to instigate a pension transfer to the Test Pension Scheme we have recommended ABC XYZ.
 
You are therefore receiving this before the 1st January 1400 deadline for the CETV so we hope all is satisfactory for you to proceed. 
 
We would be obliged if you reply as quickly as possible please, acknowledging this email and enclosures and confirming that you have all you need to process the transfer. 
 
We look forward to hearing further from you. 
 
Many thanks 
Kind regards

Hi there
 
Following the attached letter you have sent to the client (only just received today by the way as using the postal system with Covid delays around the world is not ideal) we are planning to email you all the transfer documentation you require by the deadline of 1st January, which is the CETV guarantee date, as the transfer to an overseas Test Pension Scheme is to proceed. 
 
We are just awaiting on some final documents to come through to us before we email this all through to you. 
 
You have already advised us that you will accept emailed transfer documentation, so once you receive this, you will hopefully have everything you need to process the transfer.
 
The letter you therefore sent to the client is somewhat confusing, as the CETV deadline is 1st January however, we also note in the letter that we are still able to provide you with the paperwork and the transfer can be made before 1st January 2021. 
 
We will forward the paperwork to you soon however, if you have any questions, please contact us. 
 
Thank you
Kind regards
Charlene

  2.  Can the pension be paid early, and if so what would it be worth currently annually?
  3.  If paid early or at NRD, would it be possible to fully commute the pension and if so, what would the fully commuted value be now/ at NRD?

Thanks TEST PENSIONS, I've copied all the admin details on our data so someone from the team can look into this though looking at the file there does seem to be a few emails on the file to IFA so may just be a lack of clarity on what the hold up for Mr ABC is.

Please can someone contact the client ASAP to nip this complaint in the bud


Thanks

Hi TEST FUND, 

I'm not sure if STU is around but please can you pass this on to the manager of Mr ABC's scheme please. 

I've issued an initial holding response as per the attached but this will need to be escalated accordingly. 

Thanks

Good Morning Mr ABC,

Firstly, please accept my apologies on behalf of XYZ for the problems that you have been experiencing. We take matters like this very seriously and I will do everything I can to assist you. 

Your email has come through to our specialist SIPP and SSAS Team mailbox and we are unfortunately not the area that look after your pension scheme. We also do not have access to the main pensions administration area records to enable me to search for your scheme and trace your policy. However, I have referred your email across to our Complaints Team and also to a Senior Manager in our main Pensions Administration area, to enable them to trace your scheme and make contact with you regarding this. They should be in touch with you shortly.  

In the meantime, I can also confirm that there is a Customer Service Centre for our main Pensions Administration area, which you can contact if you need to in the future by telephone on +91 012345678 or by email to test.pensions@pensions.com.

To help them to trace your scheme in the future, you may need to quote the name of the scheme, your policy reference number and your name and National Insurance number. 

I hope this is of assistance to you for the future and please rest assured that someone will be in touch with you shortly regarding your scheme.  

Kind Regards

TEST PENSIONS

Hi

I’ve sent the below message to the contact us page on your website.

""Someone needs to contact me or reply to Test IFA, with regards to transferring this pension to them, you don't respond to me you don't respond to them, nobody answers your phone. This request was first made in September and will be sent to the ombudsman this week unless you actually reply to someone""


I'll try here as well, can someone respond to this before I’m left no option but to go to the ombudsman, from my point of view you have 20k of my money you refuse to handover, I consider that a form of theft.

I know someone looks at this as I’ve been sent three useless letters in the post that achieve nothing. You need to reply to TEST IFA when they contact you.

I thought DEF had the worst customer service ever, but at least they eventually respond, this is just corporate stonewalling, have you tried using your service? it’s pathetic.

Thanks
ABC

Thanks for passing on my query to the administration to team. I wanted to share some pieces of correspendence I have previosuly received, in relation to the ‘DEF Lump Sum’.

I have attached some letters I have received, including the last letter dated 24 April 2020. In this letter it mentions about the DEF Lump Sum saying that I can take the money prior to the transfer to LMN. Are you able to give me an update on this process please? I have always been made aware that I am eligible for this lump sum, but have never been given the opportuntiy to ‘Opt In’ to it, which was stated in a previous letter.

Thanks for your email.



After months and months of correspondence from the WXYZ Pension Scheme I was lead to believe that due to the winding up of this scheme, if the value of my pension was under £18,000 - which it is, then I could take the sum as cash? I do have most of the letters so would it be easier to call someone and discuss?

Unfortunately test account was not able to retrieve a transfer value for your DEFG Pension Fund Defined Benefit Pension Scheme at this time.

There are a number of reasons why the calculation you have requested could not be retrieved automatically, for example:

You are a member of the LMN Scheme
You have a transfer in
You have had a pension sharing or earmarking order
You are within one year of retirement

Subject: LOA Request QRST TST12345678

Dear Sir/Madam,

Member Name – QRST
Member Reference – TST12345678
Scheme Name – TEST Pension Scheme

The above named has advised us that they wish to consider the possibility of a pension transfer.
Please therefore find an electronic copy of the member’s letter of authority attached, which has been password protected using the member’s National Insurance Number in the following format: 0000000000.

We are in receipt of the CETV Statement dated 26/10/2020.

Following the issue of the Defined Benefit Transfers: ABC on 8th July 2019 by The TEST  has the scheme adopted the TEST Member Quote and Scheme Templates?

If so, and the member’s enquiry can be processed as a ‘TEST standard case’, we are able to receive information in this format. Please provide the appropriate link for the TEST Scheme template for this member.

If not, in order to advise the member, we would be grateful if you could provide the following documents:
• A retirement quote for aged 55
• The member booklet applicable for their period of membership
• The latest report and accounts for the scheme (showing the most recent funding position, along with details of any recovery plan, should the scheme be underfunded on an ongoing basis)

We also require the following information, if it is not obtainable from the benefit illustrations, Scheme literature or member guides that you may be providing:

Transfer Value

1.      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Pensions Regulator are permitting schemes to apply a 3 month freeze on transfer activity. Have the Scheme Trustees already suspended, or are they planning to suspend, CETV quotations and/or CETV payments?
2.      We note that the CETV is guaranteed until 26/01/2020 but are aware that transfer values are variable to reflect fixed interest yields and actuarial assumptions. Please advise whether any changes have been made to the CETV calculation, or if any are due to be implemented, that may be more favourable to the member since the original CETV was issued?
3.      Has the transfer value been reduced to reflect any funding issues? Alternatively, has the transfer value been enhanced?
4.      Is it possible to take a partial transfer of DB Pension benefits, and if so in what circumstances?

Early Retirement
5.      Is early retirement allowed, if so from what age?
6.      What actuarial reduction factors would be applied to the member’s pension in the event of early retirement at age 55?
7.      Upon early retirement, would the member’s benefits be revalued to the date of actual retirement or normal retirement age? If benefits are revalued to NRA, what assumption is made regarding future increases?
8.      In the event of the member having to retire early due to ill health, are the benefits enhanced e.g. paid without the application of an early retirement factor? Please confirm the Trustee’s definition of ‘ill health’ in this regard.
9.      Please confirm the Trustee’s approach to Serious ill health commutation lump sums (SIHC) – including how the sum would be calculated, and on what grounds it would be paid. Would taking a SIHC sum also extinguish the spouse’s benefits within the scheme?

Early Retirement Quotation Request
10.  As the member has expressed an interest in taking benefits at 55, please provide a retirement illustration, showing both the Full Pension available, along with any Tax Free Cash and Residual Pension options offered.
11.  Does the scheme offer PIE (Pension Increase Exchange), or any other options to change the amount of initial pension and/or dependant’s pension?
12.  Please advise if there is a temporary pension included within the pension and if so, how much this is and when it will fall away i.e. the member’s actual State Pension Age of 67 or at original SPA of age.
13.  Please advise if there is a State Pension Deduction included within the pension and if so;
a.      The value of the State Pension Deduction (SPD) at date of leaving
b.      At what age the SPD applies
c.       The rate of revaluation that applies to the SPD between date of leaving and date of application (if applicable).
d.      Whether escalation on the pension in payment following the application of the SPD is based upon the pension before or after the SPD is applied.

Client Specific – please confirm the following:
14.  The member’s Final Pensionable Pay

Scheme Information
15.  Does any part of this member’s pension/service have a different normal retirement age?
a.       If so, please confirm the affected period of service, and why a different NRA applies (e.g. as a result of equalisation/transfer)
b.      The effect this has on the total benefits payable (e.g. early or late retirement factors would apply if the pension is taken at outside of those ages)
16.  Is the scheme open to all employees or are there restrictions, if so, what are they?
17.  What was the member’s accrual rate?
18.  The Excess Pension Revaluation basis; e.g. years and months rounded down
19.  Pensionable Service basis; e.g. whole years, whole years and months
20.  RPI Index month
21.  Does the scheme operate a Money Purchase Underpin for this member? If so, please confirm the most recent value.

Pension Benefits – at the date of leaving the scheme
22.  Excess benefits; showing any relevant splits (such as post 97/09/Care). Please confirm the rates of revaluation in deferment and escalation in payment for each section of benefits.
23.  Please confirm the date the excess pension is revalued in deferment e.g. anniversary of date of leaving or a specific date in the year?
24.  Statutory increases to occupational pensions are now in line with CPI instead of RPI. Please confirm whether the scheme intends to change to CPI in the future for revaluation in deferment and/or escalation in payment.
25.  Please list any discretionary increase applied to the pension either in deferment/payment during the last 5 years and has potential future discretionary increases been taken into consideration in the calculation of the CETV?
26.  Please provide a breakdown of any transferred-in benefits.
a.       If present, are these benefits treated the same as the main benefits? If not, please highlight any differences.
b.      Is there a fixed pension payable at NRA as a result of the transferred in benefit?
c.       Please provide details of any transferred-in GMP.

Tax Free Cash (TFC)
27.  Does the scheme pay HMRC post A Day maximum cash?
28.  If the HMRC maximum formula is not used, how is the Member’s TFC calculated?
29.  What is the scheme’s current TFC commutation factors?
30.  Is the TFC taken on a pro rata basis across all elements of pension or from specific slices of pensionable service?
31.  If the member takes tax free cash, is the pension increase in payment per annum applied based on pre or post commutation pension?
32.  Does the member have protected Scheme Specific Tax Free Cash that would be lost on individual transfer? If so, please advise amount at 5/4/2006 or if this client has bulk transfer protection for tax free cash?

Death Benefits
33.  Does the scheme pay a lump sum on death benefit before retirement? If so, what and how much? If a return of member contributions sum is paid, what is the interest applied to the figure?
34.  What pension would the member’s spouse and/or dependants receive upon death before and after retirement?

Pension Flexibilities
35.  Please advise if any changes to the scheme are being considered which could impact on the member? For example following the introduction of pension freedoms in 2015 will the scheme be offering: Flexi-Access Drawdown, (for the member on retirement or beneficiaries on the member’s death), Uncrystallised Fund Pension Lump Sum, (either on a full withdrawal or partial withdrawal basis), or Partial crystallisations? If so please provide details.

Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs)/Associated Defined Contribution (DC) Schemes
36.  Please provide details and options of any other associated scheme benefits the member may have and a valuation of these.

Thank you for the below email.

We have been waiting for a long time and tend to have these issues with the Ford scheme a lot when requesting information for different clients on top of having to sit on hold for over 30 minutes every time we call and keep getting told different things.

You mentioned below the CETV pack has been sent out via email earlier today? Can you please confirm as I have not received this on my email?

Further to your telephone call on 12 November 2020 and subsequent calls on 17 and 18 November 2020, please accept my sincere apologies for the delay in providing the revised transfer value for Mr ABCD.

We do pride ourselves on the quality of service that we deliver to our Corporate Clients, Trustees and most importantly, individual members. We receive relatively few complaints and do take any very seriously.
We are sorry about your dissatisfaction you have had to wait so long for the information you requested. I can advise that an email has been issued earlier today providing the transfer information.

On behalf of myself and the team at TEST, we would like to extend our apologies for any inconvenience caused and trust that you will be reassured that we do seek to minimise the number of occasions on which matters such as this arise.

Good afternoon

I write with regards to the transfer of the above members plan to the Test IFA.

Before this transfer can take place we require further information regarding the members plan held with yourselves, in order to complete our due diligence checks.

As such I would be grateful if you could confirm the following as appropriate:


  *   Is the plan a Defined Contribution / Money Purchase scheme?

     *   If so, is there a link to a Defined benefit plan, can this fund the main scheme tax free cash?
     *   Is there a Defined benefit underpin? If so what would be the value?

     *   Does the plan have any potential guarantees (i.e. GMP, 92B/Reference Scheme Test Benefits)?
        *   If so, what is the value of these?

Do you require a wet signature on the forms, or can you accept copies?

We would also be grateful if you could confirm to what extent the above answers apply to all members of this scheme who may wish to transfer. Providing this information will ensure we are able to minimise the contact we generate with you and do not contact you unnecessarily with future queries.

Finally, if you could provide the optimal contact details for contact via post, email and telephone, this will ensure work is not duplicated needlessly as it was not originally provided to the most appropriate place.

Please note, for your convenience, I have attached a copy of the client’s signed authority; the original has been sent to you in the post. The password for the attached will follow separately.

Thank you in advance.

To whom this may concern,

Please find attached a Letter of Authority for client ABC in relation to their policies/plans held with you.

I have attached a standard schedule setting out the information we require in connection with any policies held by the client with yourselves along with a full information questionnaire if you so wish to use.

If you could please fully answer all questions and return the schedule by email or post as soon as possible it would be very much appreciated.
If there are any additional features of the scheme that are relevant to any decision that might be made by our client to exercise any options under the scheme, which are not covered in this schedule, please ensure that the relevant information is provided.

We would like to draw your attention to the fact that, where the member is entitled to draw immediate retirement benefits, we have asked you to provide a quotation for this in addition to the transfer data.

Please also provide all relevant discharge, transfer and Open Market Option documents for any options involving immediate retirement or transfer.

If you anticipate that there will be a significant delay in providing all or any of the information requested, please contact us immediately to indicate when the details will be supplied.

Kind Regards

DEF

Thank you for your email.

Please note that unfortunately, you are unable to take 25% lump sum payment now. You can only take the lump sum option should you decide to retire from the Plan, with the remaining benefits paid as a pension.

You may, if you wish, transfer the full benefits to an approved pension provider, that will allow you to take part of the benefits now, however,you will need to speak to a Financial Adviser if you wish to investigate this option.

Good morning,



Thank you for your letter dated 22 October with the attached confirmation of the date the pension scheme started. However, this is not the information we require. I can confirm how you can obtain this. Please go to the website:



https://www.rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr



Within this you can navigate to get the PSTR for the scheme that you are the administrator for. When in the HMRC portal and on the screen which displays the PSTR number but not the date - rather than click the green print text on the screen - click file and print and convert to Adobe pdf. This will produce a two page document with both the date and PSTR number that satisfies the requirements.

Dear Test Pensions

I confirm receipt of your letter dated 22 October 2020 providing us with a CETV. This information did not contain a basis pension information including:

  *   Date of joining scheme
  *   Date of leaving scheme
  *   Breakdown of the pension payable as revalued to now
  *   Revaluation increases pre and post retirement.

Please could you also confirm whether you accept pension credit to be received from Mrs Hall’s spouse by way of a Pension Sharing Order.

Given that the above information is generally provided in a basis CETV report, and that my request for a CETV was registered on 24 July 2020, I should be most grateful if you could provide me with a response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards

DEF

Hi,



I am now almost 9 months into trying to obtain a cetv from yourselves. I accept that progress could not be made until I personally stopped paying into the Test pension fund. This happened on the 25th September as you probably know. I have spoken to yourselves on multiple occasions regarding obtaining my cetv before the EFG deadline which has now come and gone. I am now not even able to speak with anyone because your system cancels the call when I chose option 1 (the ongoing option). So I am requesting in writing that you please respond to this email and answer my concerns either through email or phone call on +91 012345678

Hello,

I have tried contacting you through the number given below, but because I need extension 1 (an ongoing issue) your system hangs up on me. This is extremely frustrating because this is an urgent matter and has been going on since before the pandemic stated. We are now getting on for 6 months into my request to DEF through the XYZ to get my cetv and transfer out of the Test fund.

I would request once again that you treat this as a matter of urgency.

  *   This has been an ongoing request that seems to be taking a great deal of time, even with the effects of COVID.
  *   TEST payroll sent my pension opt out confirmation to TEST/TEST pensions on November 4th 2020
  *   TEST have completed and submitted all the required forms as required by the TEST, approved and signed by myself.

  *   I am waiting for TEST to forward my guaranteed CETV to TEST
  *   Can I ask that my request to release the Guaranteed CETV is reviewed and expedite the release with some urgency
  *   Can you give me a notion of the time frame that is required to get the CETV released to TEST as I have requested .

·         I elected to opt out of the TEST Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. Which was actioned in September payroll. (email chain below)

·         I am currently trying to transfer my pension pot ( TEST Defined Benefit Pension Scheme) and as part of this thee company I have chosen to move the pot need the Guaranteed CETV.

·         I have been irregular contact (emails) with TEST (TEST pension company) to issue the CETV so I can move my pension pot.

·         I’m being informed that TEST are still waiting for my opt out details before they will make me a deferred member.



Do you know who is responsible for sending my opt out details to TEST and the Pension trustees, and what I need to do to get the opt out details issued.



If you could point me in the right direction if this isn’t anything you deal with I will be very grateful.

Hi Test Pensions

Thanks for this I have received this now.

We had already sent all the old signed documents in from the previous transfer value documents we had, as the value expired just before transfer, we had to request a new value.

Can you please confirm what the client needs to sign now as we have already sent everything in before, is It only the new signed CETV document that needs to be signed from the member?

Please let me know.

I worked for Test Pension Fundas a Data Scientist from January 2018 - September 2019. I am now working for a university and would like to transfer my Sainsbury's Argos pension into my Teachers pension. I have a form that has a section that needs to be completed by someone from Test Pension Scheme. It would be best done by hand (so printed out) but could be done electronically if necessary. I would be very grateful if you could complete part C on the attached form and return to me by the end of this week.
